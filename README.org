** Installation
Clone this repo anywhere you want, probably somewhere in =~/.emacs.d= . Then, add the directory to your =load-path=.

For example:
#+begin_example
  cd ~/.emacs.d
  git clone https://github.com/8uff3r/vue-ts-mode.git
#+end_example

Then, in =init.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "vue-ts-mode"))
  (require 'vue-ts-mode)
#+end_src

** Setup
The first time you open a =.vue= file, or =(require 'vue-ts-mode)=, you'll likely get a warning such as the following:

: Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for vue is unavailable

Because this major mode is powered by [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][Tree-sitter]], it depends on an external grammar to provide a syntax tree for Vue components. To set it up, you'll need to set =treesit-language-source-alist= to point to the correct repositories for each language. At a minimum, you'll need to specify =vue=, =typescript= and =css=, like so:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq treesit-language-source-alist
        '((vue "https://github.com/ikatyang/tree-sitter-vue")
          (css "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-css")
          (typescript "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-typescript" "master" "tsx/src")))
#+end_src

Once that's been setup, you'll need to run =treesit-install-language-grammar= once for each language in the list. You can do this interactively (=M-x=), or by evaluating this snippet:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (mapc #'treesit-install-language-grammar '(vue css typescript))
#+end_src

Make sure you have a working C compiler as =cc= in your PATH, since this needs to compile the grammars.
